                <p>
                    The Meta Side Table is one of our signature pieces
                    and well suited to all communal living spaces and bedrooms.
                    Consisting of a series of arranged, powder coated rectangular and circular shapes,
                    Meta&apos;s appearance changes from delicate and thin, to substantial and full depending
                    on the viewing angle. Featuring multi-directional storage for your reading material
                    and an even top for decorative accessories.

                <h4>Click Shelf</h4>
                <p>
                    Click is a boltless shelving system. The minimalistic form and construction,
                    as well as the visual lightness, form the aesthetic characteristics of the shelf.
                    Constructed of 1.5mm thin sheet steel, a girder and shelves, the system functions
                    similar to a construction kit. Only four screws fix the girder together to which
                    the shelves are simply hung up without any tools. The material and precision of the
                    components guarantee the stability and assembly.

                <h4>Float Shelf</h4>
                <p>Designed as a versatile storage option, the Float Shelf is open to diverse
                    interpretations â€“ holding a book as a bedside or side table, bearing weight
                    as wall console, storing a magazine collection, serving as a compact standing desk,
                    or safeguarding small personal essentials as a hallway tray. The Float Shelf equally
                    adds a touch of character to hotel rooms, boutique accommodation and boardinghouses.
                    Embodying purity at its most elegant degree, the strict geometry of this wall-mounted
                    shelf lends its form a sculptural appeal. The Float Shelf consists of two offset levels
                    cut from a single sheet of aluminum, with a simple two-fold composition allowing for
                    flexible placement, use and display. Referencing the reduced aesthetic principles
                    of modernism in the Bauhaus tradition, its design distils the essence of a shelf.
